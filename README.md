Dynamic Programming

How to recognise. 
1. Chosie. 
2. Optimal (max or min) ask in question. 


```

2. top down (recursive + memoisation)

There are three type of knapsack 
1. Fractional Knap ---> greedy method 
2. 0/1 Knapsack
3. Unbounded Knapsack

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Part-1 
[0/1 Knapsack]

in knapsack either take or not take in both case item is processed. 
 
after processed never include in knapsack. 
```
Questions:
1. Subset sum problem
2. equal sum partition 
3. count of subset sum given sum 
4. minimum subset sum difference
5. Target sum 
6. count of subset with given difference 
```
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

Part-2 
Unbounded Knapsack
if not take then it is processed. 

if take then it will not processed. 
Questions:
```
1. Rod Cutting. 
2. Coin Change -1
3. Coin Change -2
4. Maximum Ribbon Cut. 
```

Part-3

Longest Common Subsequence. [LCS]

Question:
```
0. Longest Common Subsequence. [LCS]
1. Longest comman substring. ++ must be continious. 
2. Print LCS
3. Shortest Comman Supersequence [SCS]
4. Print SCS
5. Minimum no of insertion and deletion. 
6. Largest repeating subsequence. 
7. Lenth of longest subsequence fo  'a' which is a substring in 'b'.
8. Subseqence Pattern Matching 
9. Count How Many time 'a' appear as subsequenc in 'b'.
10. Longest palindromic subsequence. 
11. Longest palindromic substring. 
12. count of palindromic substring. 
13. Min no of deletion in a string to make it a palindrom. 
14. Min no of insertion string to make it a palindrom. 
```
Trick:

If You want max or longest then find maximum of those option .
